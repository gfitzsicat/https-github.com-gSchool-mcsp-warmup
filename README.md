## Running the Squirrel Play Test Cases

This repository contains test cases for the "squirrel play" problem in JavaScript using the `vitest` library.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have the following software installed on your computer to run the test cases:

-   Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)

### Steps

1. (If you haven't already) Clone this repository to your local computer.
2. Navigate to the `01_SquirrelPlay` directory within the repository.
3. Open solution.js in your code editor. Implement the function signature to pass the test cases.
4. Run the test cases by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run w1
```

The tests should now run and give you the results of each test case. If any of the test cases fail, you'll see a detailed error message indicating what went wrong and where the issue is located.
